Using several graph-algorithms such as BFS, Kruskal's Algorithm, and Djisktra's Algorithm I created an
Airport Efficiency Model creating a Regional Network and Global Network. The maximum regional net
minimizes total distance, cost, while maximizes connectivity between airport and total flights offered from each
airport. The global network takes multiple regional nets and finds the shortest path from each region to another.
